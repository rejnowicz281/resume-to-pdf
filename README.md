## About

resume-to-pdf allows you to create a minimalistic, clean and personalized CV according to your tastes. It also allows you to save multiple resumes, and to export any of them directly in **PDF** and **JSON** format.

This project is **responsive** and **mobile-friendly**.

For the preview of the PDF and exporting functionality, the **@react-pdf/renderer** package was used.\
To allow the displaying of the PDF on mobile devices, wojtekmaj's **@react-pdf** package was used.

([@react-pdf/renderer Github repo](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf)).

([wojtekmaj's react-pdf Github repo](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf)).

For the components, the **shadcn** component library was used. For the icons, the **lucide-react** library was used.

## Local Storage

The project uses **localStorage** to store the resumes.
This means that the resumes are stored in the browser's local storage and are not shared with any server. This also means that the resumes are not available on other devices.\
To transport your resumes to another device, you can download them as a JSON file and then import them on another device. Although not the most convenient, it is the only option available at the moment. Might add a dedicated server to store the resumes in the future.

## Localization

The project is available in two languages: **English** and **Polish**.\
You can change the language in the settings.

## Offline Functionality

The project uses **PWA** technology and can be installed on your mobile and desktop device.\
The app is also fully offline-friendly, meaning you don't need an internet connection to use it.
